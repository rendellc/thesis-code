\section{Angular momentum}

Want to determine the rotation of a rigid body based on the forces applied to it.

\todo[inline]{Might be a good idea with some citations here}


Angular momentum is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum.

For a single particle with mass $m$, velocity $\vec{v}$, at an arbitrary distance $\vec{r}$ from the origin it is rotating about, the angular momentum $\vec{L}$ is given as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:angular-momentum}
  \vec{L} = \vec{r} \times m \vec{v}
\end{equation}

Large objects like vehicles can be treated as single particles by considering only the center of mass and its velocity.
