\section{Wheel dynamics}

This section contains reading notes from \cite{rill}.


\cite{rill} points out that the dynamics of wheels are stiff, since wheels can brake in an instant. This requires an implicit ode solver or a soft braking model.

The paper shows and demonstrates that explicit methods will lead to singularities when the velocity is low by using a simple linear chassis/wheel model.
